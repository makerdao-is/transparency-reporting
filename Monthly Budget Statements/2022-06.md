Regarding Compensation & Benefits, Travin decided to forfeit the remainder of his compensation [due to errors related to bug 5570](https://medium.com/@joshua_24955/makerdao-authentication-vulnerability-bugfix-review-e9cf42c7402f).

Regarding Professional Services, we did not use ChainSecurity. Immunefi mistakenly invoiced us for 50k instead of 55k.
