## 2. Budget Forecast

|Expense Type|Jun 2022|Jul 2022|Aug 2022|3-month|Budget Cap|Budget Cap + Buffer|
|------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|----------|-------------------|
|Periodic    |188,500 |133,083 |133,083 |454,667|466,250   |536,188            |
|One-time    |26      |26      |26      |77     |63,700    |73,255             |

We regard the cost of the Operational Audits as a periodic
expense because it will be invoiced on an hourly basis.
