The compensation of 13,200 in Feb includes deferred compensation from Dec 2022 and Jan 2023 (3 * 4,400 = 13,200). MIP14c2-SP2 authorized a compensation of 6,600 per month (24 hours a week). However, we discovered that it was feasible to cut our hours to 16 hours a week by not attending meetings and neglecting the forums and Discord. Narrowing our focus to bug triaging seemed consistent with our goal of dissolving as a Core Unit and becoming or merging with an ecosystem actor. This decision also extends our runway from 6 to 9 months (to August 2023).

We forecast a gas cost of 500 per month from the Contingency Buffer.

To pay for future gas, we request that auditors also return 0.323 ETH back to our operational wallet. The current value of this ETH, about 520 DAI, fits within our contingency buffer.
